THE SCRIPT COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRENTY - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK

This is a very basic script hacked up in about 5 minutes to take the XML file containing all the build jobs in Bamboo 
(Usually called administrationConfiguration.xml) into the Jenkins format. 

When I wrote this, our Bamboo jobs were named CON, DAILY, and REL. CON was for continuous builds and would poll the SCM every 5 minutes, 
DAILY would run every night and REL would be manual. 

You might need to edit this accordingly or use some other method of setting the build_frequency. 

The script will create an output directory, under which a number of build folders will be created for each job and an xml file in each one. 

After the script has run, copy the folders in the output folder to your Jenkins installation and reload the data to see them all appear.
